# The-line-follower-robot
### The problem that we are trying to slove. 
We want the line following robot to follow a 10 foot electrical tape line and blink at the end in 30 seconds or less, or We can time the robot to see if it solves and moves fast enough.

### What should it look like:
It would either look like a plane or car. We can make it whatever shape and look how we want when it comes time to build. 
To make the robot stop we would have it programmed where if both sensors see black then it will stop. Put electrical tape perpendicular to the end of the trail.

### What components will it use?
Arduino, light sensors, breadboard, wheels, servo. 

### How does this solution solve the problem?
We want the line following robot to follow a 10 foot electrical tape line and blink at the end in 30 seconds or less.

### Description
Our goal for this project is that we want to get this project done fast. And we want it to work really well, We also can't wait to see it working.
