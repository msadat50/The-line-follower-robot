# The-line-follower-robot
### The problem that we are trying to slove. 
We want the line following robot to follow a 10 foot electrical tape line and blink at the end in 30 seconds or less, or We can time the robot to see if it solves and moves fast enough.

### What should it look like:
It would either look like a plane or car. We can make it whatever shape and look how we want when it comes time to build. 
To make the robot stop we would have it programmed where if both sensors see black then it will stop. Put electrical tape perpendicular to the end of the trail.

### What components will it use?
Arduino, light sensors, breadboard, wheels, servo. 

### How does this solution solve the problem?
We want the line following robot to follow a 10 foot electrical tape line and blink at the end in 30 seconds or less. 

### Images

These pictures are the series showing how our prototype design evolved and was built. The first image is when we started,and the design was refined and evolved over time.

The IR sensors will go under the front edge of the 'platform' and read the lines' movements. The final product may be in the shape of a plane, car or something else, we have not decided yet.

### Description
Our goal for this project is that we want to get this project done fast. And we want it to work really well, We also can't wait to see it working. 
We are almost done with the project I attacked the motors we just need to do the wheels and we need to fix the platform so the motors holes go through the platform holes.
