# The-line-follower-robot
### The problem that we are trying to slove. 
We want the line following robot to follow a 10 foot electrical tape line and blink at the end in 30 seconds or less, or We can time the robot to see if it solves and moves fast enough.

### What should it look like:
It would either look like a plane or car. We can make it whatever shape and look how we want when it comes time to build. 
To make the robot stop we would have it programmed where if both sensors see black then it will stop. Put electrical tape perpendicular to the end of the trail.

### What components will it use?
Arduino, light sensors, breadboard, wheels, servo. 

### How does this solution solve the problem?
We want the line following robot to follow a 10 foot electrical tape line and blink at the end in 30 seconds or less. 

### Images

These pictures are the series showing how our prototype design evolved and was built. The first image is when we started,and the design was refined and evolved over time.

The IR sensors will go under the front edge of the 'platform' and read the lines' movements. 
I haven't yet figured out how the bearings are mounted, but once I do there will be 2 bearings, one under each corner of the flat short top of the platform. They will be by the corners of it,that way there is room for the Uv sensor in the center under the front.

### Description
Our goal for this project is that we want to get this project done fast. And we want it to work really well, We also can't wait to see it working. 
We are almost done with the project I attacked the motors we just need to do the wheels and we need to fix the platform so the motors holes go through the platform holes.
We want our Robot to complete our maze of 10 feet in 30 seconds or less. When it completes the maze, we may have leds flash to celebrate. 
I am done with testing the sensor but I am not fully done with the LED coding and wiring I am trying to make the 2 LED blink when the sensor see the line. In the picture as you see when the sensor is on, the LED is off so I need to make the LED and sensor turn on at the same time.
